Usage

Initial Setup:

After uploading the code to your ESP32, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
Set the baud rate to 115200.
The ESP32 will attempt to connect to your WiFi network and initialize the SD card. Look for messages in the Serial Monitor indicating the connection status and SD card initialization.
Recording Audio:

To start recording audio, press and hold the button connected to pin_RECORD_BTN on your ESP32.
The LED connected to LED pin will turn on, indicating that recording is in progress.
Release the button to stop recording. The system will then process the audio file for transcription.
Viewing Transcription:

Once the recording is stopped, the system will send the recorded audio file to Deepgram for transcription.
The transcribed text will be displayed in the Serial Monitor.
Ensure that you have a stable WiFi connection to successfully send data to the Deepgram API and receive the transcription results.
LED Indicators:

The LED will turn on when recording or when the system is processing the audio.
It will turn off when the system is idle or has completed processing.
Troubleshooting:

If the system fails to connect to WiFi, verify your network credentials in the code.
If the SD card initialization fails, check the connections and ensure that the SD card is properly inserted and formatted.
